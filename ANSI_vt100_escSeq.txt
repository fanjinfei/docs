Many computer terminals and terminal emulators support colour and cursor control through a system of escape sequences. One such standard is commonly referred to as ANSI Colour. Several terminal specifications are based on the ANSI colour standard, including VT100.

The following is a partial listing of the VT100 control set.

<ESC> represents the ASCII "escape" character, 0x1B. Bracketed tags represent modifiable decimal parameters; eg. {ROW} would be replaced by a row number.

Arrow-Up key: 0x1b, 0x5b, 0x41, or "\033[A".

1. Device Status
The following codes are used for reporting terminal/display settings, and vary depending on the implementation:

  Query Device Code	<ESC>[c
    Requests a Report Device Code response from the device.

  Report Device Code	<ESC>[{code}0c
    Generated by the device in response to Query Device Code request.

  Query Device Status	<ESC>[5n
    Requests a Report Device Status response from the device.

  Report Device OK	<ESC>[0n
    Generated by the device in response to a Query Device Status request; indicates that device is functioning correctly.

  Report Device Failure	<ESC>[3n
    Generated by the device in response to a Query Device Status request; indicates that device is functioning improperly.

  Query Cursor Position	<ESC>[6n
    Requests a Report Cursor Position response from the device.

  Report Cursor Position	<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}R
    Generated by the device in response to a Query Cursor Position request; reports current cursor position.

2. Terminal Setup
The h and l codes are used for setting terminal/display mode, and vary depending on the implementation. Line Wrap is one of the few setup codes that tend to be used consistently:

  Reset Device		<ESC>c
    Reset all terminal settings to default.

  Enable Line Wrap	<ESC>[7h
    Text wraps to next line if longer than the length of the display area.

  Disable Line Wrap	<ESC>[7l
    Disables line wrapping.

3. Fonts
Some terminals support multiple fonts: normal/bold, swiss/italic, etc. There are a variety of special codes for certain terminals; the following are fairly standard:

  Font Set G0		<ESC>(
    Set default font.

  Font Set G1		<ESC>)
    Set alternate font.

4. Cursor Control

  Cursor Home		<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}H
    Sets the cursor position where subsequent text will begin. If no row/column parameters are provided (ie. <ESC>[H), the cursor will move to the home position, at the upper left of the screen.

  Cursor Up		<ESC>[{COUNT}A
    Moves the cursor up by COUNT rows; the default count is 1.

  Cursor Down		<ESC>[{COUNT}B
    Moves the cursor down by COUNT rows; the default count is 1.

  Cursor Forward		<ESC>[{COUNT}C
    Moves the cursor forward by COUNT columns; the default count is 1.

  Cursor Backward		<ESC>[{COUNT}D
    Moves the cursor backward by COUNT columns; the default count is 1.

  Force Cursor Position	<ESC>[{ROW};{COLUMN}f
    Identical to Cursor Home.

  Save Cursor		<ESC>[s
    Save current cursor position.

  Unsave Cursor		<ESC>[u
    Restores cursor position after a Save Cursor.

  Save Cursor & Attrs	<ESC>7
    Save current cursor position.

  Restore Cursor & Attrs	<ESC>8
    Restores cursor position after a Save Cursor.

5. Scrolling
  Scroll Screen		<ESC>[r
    Enable scrolling for entire display.

  Scroll Screen		<ESC>[{start};{end}r
    Enable scrolling from row {start} to row {end}.

  Scroll Down		<ESC>D
    Scroll display down one line.

  Scroll Up		<ESC>M
    Scroll display up one line.

6. Tab Control
  Set Tab		<ESC>H
    Sets a tab at the current position.

  Clear Tab		<ESC>[g
    Clears tab at the current position.

  Clear All Tabs	<ESC>[3g
    Clears all tabs.

7. Erasing Text
  Erase End of Line	<ESC>[K
    Erases from the current cursor position to the end of the current line.

  Erase Start of Line	<ESC>[1K
    Erases from the current cursor position to the start of the current line.

  Erase Line		<ESC>[2K
    Erases the entire current line.

  Erase Down		<ESC>[J
    Erases the screen from the current line down to the bottom of the screen.

  Erase Up		<ESC>[1J
    Erases the screen from the current line up to the top of the screen.

  Erase Screen		<ESC>[2J
    Erases the screen with the background colour and moves the cursor to home.

8. Printing
Some terminals support local printing:

  Print Screen		<ESC>[i
    Print the current screen.

  Print Line		<ESC>[1i
    Print the current line.

  Stop Print Log		<ESC>[4i
    Disable log.

  Start Print Log		<ESC>[5i
    Start log; all received text is echoed to a printer.

8. Define Key
  Set Key Definition	<ESC>[{key};"{string}"p
    Associates a string of text to a keyboard key. {key} indicates the key by its ASCII value in decimal.

9. Set Display Attributes
Set Attribute Mode	<ESC>[{attr1};...;{attrn}m
Sets multiple display attribute settings. The following lists standard attributes:

    0	Reset all attributes
    1	Bright
    2	Dim
    4	Underscore	
    5	Blink
    7	Reverse
    8	Hidden
